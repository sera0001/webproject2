        Description: A simple chat application allows users to communicate in real-time over a network. This project is a basic introduction to socket programming.
      </p>

      <h3>How it Works:</h3>
      <p>
        Client-Server Architecture: The application follows a client-server model.
        Sockets: Use sockets for communication between the client and server.
        Message Exchange: Clients can send messages to the server, and the server broadcasts the messages to all connected clients.
        User Interface: Implement a basic user interface for clients to input and display messages.
      </p>
