      <p>
        User-Item Interaction Data: Collect data on user interactions with items, such as ratings, views, or purchases.
        Collaborative Filtering: Collaborative filtering methods identify patterns by comparing users or items based on their behavior.
        Content-Based Filtering: Content-based methods recommend items similar to those the user has already shown interest in.
        Hybrid Methods: Combine collaborative and content-based approaches for improved accuracy.
