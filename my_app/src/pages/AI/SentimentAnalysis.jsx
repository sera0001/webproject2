      </p>

      <h3>How it Works:</h3>
      <p>
        Text Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data, including tasks like tokenization and removing stop words.
        Feature Extraction: Convert the text data into numerical features that can be used by machine learning models.
        Training Data: Train a machine learning model on a labeled dataset, where each text is associated with a sentiment label.
        Model Training: Common models include Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, or neural networks.
        Prediction: Use the trained model to predict the sentiment of new text data.
