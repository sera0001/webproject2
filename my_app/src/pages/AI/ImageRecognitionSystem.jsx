      <p>
        Description: An image recognition system can identify and classify objects or patterns within images. This technology is widely used in applications like facial recognition, object detection, and autonomous vehicles.
      </p>

      <h3>How it Works:</h3>
      <p>
        Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are a common architecture for image recognition. They consist of layers that learn hierarchical features from images.
        Training Data: The system is trained on a labeled dataset, where images are paired with corresponding labels.
        Forward Pass: During inference, the input image goes through a forward pass in the trained network, and the final layer produces predictions.
        Softmax Activation: A softmax activation function is often used to convert the network's raw output into probability scores for different classes.
        Class Prediction: The class with the highest probability is considered the predicted class for the image.
