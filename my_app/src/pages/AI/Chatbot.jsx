        Description: A chatbot is a conversational agent that can interact with users through natural language. It can be used for various applications, including customer support, information retrieval, and task automation.
      </p>

      <h3>How it Works:</h3>
      <p>
        Natural Language Processing (NLP): The chatbot uses NLP techniques to understand and interpret user input. This involves tokenizing, parsing, and extracting meaningful information from the text.
        Intent Recognition: The system identifies the user's intent, determining what the user is asking or requesting.
        Response Generation: Based on the recognized intent, the chatbot generates an appropriate response. This can involve using pre-defined templates or, in more advanced cases, generating responses using machine learning models.
        Continuous Learning: Some chatbots incorporate machine learning to improve over time by learning from user interactions.
