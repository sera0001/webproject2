        Description: A fractal generator creates complex and intricate patterns using recursive mathematical equations.
      </p>

      <h3>How it Works:</h3>
      <p>
        Mathematical Definition: Fractals are often defined by recursive mathematical formulas.
        Iterative Calculation: The fractal image is generated through iterative calculations based on the mathematical definition.
        Visualization: Render the calculated data into an image for visualization.
        Parameter Adjustments: Allow users to explore different fractal patterns by adjusting parameters.
      </p>
