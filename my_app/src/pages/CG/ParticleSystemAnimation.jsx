        Description: A particle system simulates the behavior of individual particles, often used for effects like fire, smoke, or rain in computer graphics.
      </p>

      <h3>How it Works:</h3>
      <p>
        Particle Representation: Define attributes for each particle, such as position, velocity, and color.
        Simulation: Update particle positions over time based on their velocity and other attributes.
        Rendering: Render particles as points or small textures.
        User Interaction: Allow users to manipulate the particle system or adjust parameters.
      </p>
