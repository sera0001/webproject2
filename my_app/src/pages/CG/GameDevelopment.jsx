        Description: Creating a simple 2D game involves designing graphics, implementing game logic, and handling user input.
      </p>

      <h3>How it Works:</h3>
      <p>
        Game Loop: Implement a game loop that continuously updates the game state and renders graphics.
        Sprites and Animation: Use sprites to represent game objects, and animate them by changing their positions or images.
        Collision Detection: Implement algorithms to detect collisions between game objects.
        User Input: Handle user input for controlling game elements.
      </p>
